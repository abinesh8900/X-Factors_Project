                <p>This baseline of every company is really the differentiator between success and failure. At XFactor, we have invested in our baseline by
                  building a family, rather than just a company with employees and bosses. We all wear several hats and are unified in working together for
                  the same cause – to offer an exceptional product. We encourage transparency, and we support each other; there are no private offices, and
                  everyone has the founders’ phone numbers – and uses them!</p>
                  
                <p>We all are part of the collective team and support a feeling of inclusion and comfort. That is why we decided to put our offices in an apartment
                  building – to provide a homey feeling in a place where people would be happy to come, where they could feel comfortable. It’s really important to
                  us to ensure our office has a warm and supportive environment. In addition to eating lunch together several times a week, our employees create friendships
                  that extend beyond the office.

                  <p>– Enterprising: Each team member must be resourceful and creative problem solvers. Each of our team members is considered an intrapreneur and is expected to own their responsibilities. This higher level perspective towards a team member’s responsibilities incites more deliberate behaviour and holistic thinking on behalf of the company.</p>
                  <p>– Kaizen: This is the ideology coined by Toyota that believes that everything can be improved and deserves to be improved. Each of our team members strives to improve themselves at least a little bit every day and everything around them. Each team member looks at every facet of the company and has the top of mind question in their head at all times, How can this be improved?

              <h5>The learned (and assumed) behavior patterns within an organization.</h5>
              <p>Culture is the most powerful tool for creating value that an organization has, because it directs behavior. Company culture is comprised of the learned
                 (or assumed) behavior patterns within an organization. A key element of these behavior patterns is that they are built on deeper assumptions. So, the
                 three important components of company culture are that they are learned, they are patterns and there is an underlying assumption driving them.
                 </p><div class="read_more mutualFit_read_more_click">Read more</div>

              <div class="mutualFit_read_more">
                <p>Culture is important because it helps explain and predict how individuals and teams will behave. It’s important to acknowledge each of the three components.
                  Acknowledging that culture is learned helps us see that changing it will take time and effort; we learn things through experience, so if we want to impact
                  culture, we need to create the right experiences, not just change processes. Acknowledging that culture is a pattern of behavior helps us focus on the behaviors 
                  we see broadly rather than those that are isolated. Acknowledging that culture is based on assumptions helps us address the root, by addressing the underlying
                  assumptions driving behavior we enable change.</p>
               <p>When we see productive or unproductive behavior patterns in the organization we can ask, “what assumption might be driving the behavior?” and “what experiences
                  might lead to those assumptions?”. If you want a culture of teamwork, but see a pattern of self-promotion and independence, asking these questions might lead to
                  seeing how the company rewards and recognizes individual contributors more than it does teams. You can then work on creating experiences that contradict this
                  assumption, leading to culture change.

              <p>Company culture, at it’s root, isn’t about logo-wear or on-site child care or Friday keggers. Culture can be observed and monitored in the quality of your organization’s
                 work environment – whether people are treated with trust, respect, and dignity in every interaction.

                <p>Most leaders invest more time and energy in managing results and profits than they do their organization’s culture, yet culture drives everything that happens in that 
                  organization, for better or worse.</p>
                <p>Managing results is certainly important. But managing results is only HALF the leader’s job. The other half? Managing the quality of the work environment, the health of 
                  the organization’s culture.</p>
                <p>When leaders create a purposeful, positive, productive work culture, amazing things happen. Employee engagement goes up by 40% or more. Customer service ratings go up by
                  40% or more. Results and profits go up, too – by 35% or more, all within 18 months of engaging in a shift to a culture where people are treated with respect, daily.</p>
                <p>To create a purposeful, positive, productive culture, leaders must make values as important as results. They must make values – how people treat each other daily 
                  – as observable, tangible, and measurable as performance metrics.</p>
                <p>Values become measurable when defined in behavioral terms. A value like “integrity” sounds great but if leaders “assume” that everyone knows how to act with integrity, 
                  they’ll be surprised quite quickly. Shared values, defined in behavioral terms, means that everyone knows exactly how they must behave to demonstrate their integrity value.</p>
                <p>For example, one client includes in their integrity value a behavior of “I do what I say I will do.” That behavior is observable, tangible, and measurable in the way a player 
                  acts daily. With valued behaviors in place, and leaders that model those valued behaviors daily, employees will embrace those behaviors.</p>
                <p>Don’t leave your culture to chance – be intentional with behaviorally defined values.

              <p>The ‘what’ of a company is the reason they are in business, what generates the money that supports their existence. The company culture is the ‘how’ of what they do. As an organization, 
                 how are employees, clients, customers treated? How a company functions needs to be defined and committed to by everyone. Although what the company does is of utmost importance because 
                 it forms the economic driver, how this is completed is also very important, creating the relational aspect. Culture contributes to the ‘bottom line’ when one considers the factors that 
                 can influence employee performance.

              <div class="adaptability_read_more">
                <p>Factors related to employee performance typically outlined in organizational values govern how employees are treated within the organization. Some examples include respect, dignity, inclusion, 
                  trust, being seen, heard and understood, payment for services provided, support(learning and growth) and generally how they are treated by their peers and managers. If the culture includes all 
                  of the factors mentioned above, employees are engaged, proud to be a member of the organization, accountable for their actions and committed to the company’s overall success. Morale is high, 
                  employees thrive, production is of high quality and innovation abounds. Clients and customers are listened to with the goal of ensuring their needs are met and if possible exceeded.</p>
               <p>If the ‘how’ includes none of the above, employees will disengage, decrease productivity ensuring they do the minimum of what is required, have increased absences and make frequent errors. 
                  This results in the creation of inferior quality products/services and leads to poor morale and frequent staff turnover not to mention increased stress and tension that leads to conflict. 
                  It is easy to see how a company culture bereft of these factors also impacts the bottom line, in an adverse way.
